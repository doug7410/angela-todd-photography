  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I love light. I love how light changes how we process the world around us, while it manipulates our emotions inside
    us. That love got me into photography and motivates me to this day, because photography is nothing less than
    capturing the fastest thing in the universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want my photography to help me understand light better and to capture
    the emotion of the light. My photography is not meant to be a faithful recreation of what my eyes saw, but a
    faithful recreation of what I experienced emotionally in that moment.
